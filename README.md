# Kirby Kirby Section Block (Beta)

## Overview

Section wrapper block that contains column blocks.

Due to the success of [Column Blocks](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-column-blocks) and [Grid block](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-grid-block), i've been created an improved version based on your suggestions.

## Installation

**Manually**

[Download](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-section-block) and copy the plugin into your plugin folder: `/site/plugins/`

**With Composer**

`composer require microman/kirby-section-block:^1.0-beta`

## How to use

Just follow the [Kirby Blocks instructions](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks).

Set up your blueprint:

``` yaml
my_block:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
        - section
        ... even more if you like
```

Set up your output:

``` php
<?php foreach ($page->my_block()->toBlocks() as $block): ?>
   
    <?= $block ?>

<?php endforeach ?>
```

## Example

Let's make an example (like in the screenshot):

### Set up the section block

Let's say you want to give your editors the ability to set the maximum width of your section.

`site/blueprints/fields/sections.yml` (Keep in mind: `fields` folder not `blocks`!)
``` yml
fields:
  max_width:
    type: number
    after: px
```
*The section block has not possibilities to define the styling for the backend.*

### Set up the column block

Now, we set the background field. We can use the given value, later for our backend styling. And also we set a few fielsets for our content blocks.

`site/blueprints/fields/columns.yml`
```yml
fields:
  background:
    type: colors
    alpha: true
  content:
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
```
*This setup needs a color field. Check [this](https://getkirby.com/plugins/hananils/colors) out...*

### Set up column types

You're free how much types you want to offer. But set at least one or delete the `blueprints/columns` folder for the 3 defaults.
Here we use *full width* for instance and set the styling for the backend. The background value comes from our color field we defined before.

`site/blueprints/columns/xxx.yml`
```xml
title: Full Width
icon: col_1_1
width: "1/1"
style:
    background: background
    border: 1px solid black
```

## Customize the output

The best way to do this, is to copy `snippets/blocks/section` from the plugin folder to your site folder.
You'il easely understanding, whats going on there.

Let me just say something about the `$column->column_width()` method (with *1/2* as example):

- Without any parameter, you'il get the original value like this: 1/2
- Set a number as parameter, the width will be divided by this: `column_width(100)` -> *50*  `column_width(12)` -> *6*
- Any other character is a separator: `column_width('_')` -> *1_2*

## Inherit the section block 

I general you set up like above and you're good to go. But sometimes you need the section block anywhere else with different settings. Let me show you how to do this.

### Customize the section

Let say, in one place you need to add a new field for you section. Let's do it:

``` yml
my_custom_block:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    section:
      extends: blocks/section
      fields:
        new_section_field:
          type: text
```

### Customize the column types

``` yml
my_custom_block:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    section:
      extends: blocks/section
      fields:
          columns:
            options:
              custom_type1:
                title: Half and Red Background
                icon: col_1_2
                width: "1/2"
                style:
                    background: red
              custom_type1:
                title: Half and Blue Background
                icon: col_1_2
                width: "1/2"
                style:
                    background: blue
```

### Customize column block

In this example we like to add a new field to the column and overwrite the fieldsets.

``` yml
my_custom_block:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    section:
      extends: blocks/section
      fields:
          columns:
            fieldsets:
              column:
                extends: blocks/column
                fields:
                  new_column_field:
                    type: text
                  content:
                    fieldsets:
                      - video
                      - image
```

Phew! 🥵 A lot of indents.
And no, it's no possible to set different column fieldsets for a specific column type. But if you like to implement it, feel free and make a [pull request](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-section-block/pulls).


**Have fun with it!**
